Using the XYGStudy 3 Relay Pi hat, I created a Python program as directed by the
website: https://tutorals-raspberrypi.com/raspberry-pi-control-relay-switch-via-
gpio/

The relay hat starts will all circuits open, which does not allow the power supp
ly to immediately ignite the igniter. It also has 3 inputs on each relay,
one on the leftmost side that is only cirucit complete with the other two
 on the right side if the relay is closed (LOW). The positive side of a 12V 
battery supply was connected to relay 3's middle, and the left side of the 
relay was connected with a seperate wire to one of the igniter's ends.
The negative side of the battery was connected to the other side of the
igniter. Relay 3's GPIO pin on the Pi's board is pin 40.

This relay also needs to be set LOW in order to trigger the mechanism to be 
closed, and defaults to HIGH.

The lines of the program are as follows:

import RPi.GPIO as GPIO
GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BOARD)
GPIO.setup(40,GPIO.OUT) #Pin40 on Pi is set to output
GPIO.output(40,GPIO.HIGH) #Pin40 set High
GPIO.output(40,GPIO.LOW) #Pin40 set Low

After executing this program, the igniter immedately was set off, and turning 
off the power supply or setting GPIO.output(40,GPIO.HIGH) would turn off the 
current to the igniter.
