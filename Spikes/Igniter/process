Using the XYGStudy 3 Relay Pi hat, I created a Python program as directed by the
website: https://tutorals-raspberrypi.com/raspberry-pi-control-relay-switch-via-
gpio/

The relay hat starts will all circuits open, which does not allow the power supp
ly to immediately ignite the igniter.

This relay also needs to be set LOW in order to trigger the mechanism to be 
closed.

The lines of the program are as follows:

import RPi.GPIO as GPIO
GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BOARD)
GPIO.setup(40,GPIO.OUT) #Pin40 on Pi is set to output
GPIO.output(40,GPIO.HIGH) #Pin40 set High
GPIO.output(40,GPIO.LOW) #Pin40 set Low

After executing this program, the igniter immedately was set off, and turning 
off the power supply or setting GPIO.output(40,GPIO.HIGH) would turn off the 
current to the igniter.
