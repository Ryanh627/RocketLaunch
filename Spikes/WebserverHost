I used my Raspberry Pi 3 B+, and no other materials.

Following the instructions on the website: 
http://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/wireless/access-point.md

I set up my raspberry pi to use it's wifi as a standalone network that was capable of being connected to by other devices.

Using Apache2, which is installed by running the command
"sudo apt install apache2"
I succesfully connected to the raspberry pi on my phone, and typed in the pi's 
ipaddress into my phone's browser, and successfully pulled up the default
apache test page, proving that my pi was hosting the website on the local 
network.
