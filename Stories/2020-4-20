Release One:

users:
    Range Master (RM)
    rocket owner

Range Master:

1)  As an RM,
    I want to be able to log into the local web server with an administrator account
    So that I can manage the other users and launch rockets only with my permission.
        est. time:
        Risk: 5
        Hours spent: 0
  

2)  As an RM,
    I want to be able to be able to set up to three rockets and be notified which rockets are ready to launch
    So that I know which rockets are ready and launch them individually.
        est. time:
        Risk: 5
        Hours spent: 0


3)  As an RM,
    I want to have a physical master switch that is required to launch the rockets
    So as to minimize the risk of an unplanned launch as much as possible.
        est. time:
        Risk: 5
        Hours spent: 0


4)  As an RM,
    In the event of a miss fire, I want to be notified and have the master switch automatically turn off 
    So there are safty measures in the event of a miss fire.
        est. time:
        Risk: 7
        Hours spent: 0


5)  As an RM,
    I want the following rocket data to be recorded and saved to the web server during launch  
        -Launch video
        -estimated height
        -current wind speeds
    So that the rocket owners are able to retrieve this data in the future.
        est. time:
        Risk: 9
        Hours spent: 0


Rocket Owner:

1)  As a Rocket Owner,
    I want to be able to create my own account and log into the web server
    so that I am able to participate with the rocket launch.
        est. time:
        Risk: 5
        Hours spent: 0


2)  As a Rocket Owner,
    I want to be able to customize my profile,
        -Profile picture
        -Full Name
        -Nick Name
        -Email
    so that I am able to connect with other rocet owners.
        est. time:
        Risk: 5
        Hours spent: 0

3)  As a Rocket Owner,
    I want the recorded data from my Rocket to be emailed to me if I have an email on profile
    so that I am able to access this data without access to the web server.
